            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul class="list unordered">
                    <li>1,5 pound ground beef</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                    <li>0,25 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>4 slices of your favorite cheese</li>
                    <li>4 hamburger bunds, split</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol class="list ordered">
                    <li>Combine ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well. 
                        Form 8, thin patties from the beef. Each patty should be slightly larger than a slice of cheese.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cut each slice of the cheese into 4 equal pieces; stack the pieces. 
                        Sandwich one stack of cheese between 2 ground beef patties. 
                        Tightly pinch edges together tightly seal the cheese within the meat. 
                        Repeat with the remaining cheese and patties.
                    </li>
                    <li>Preheat a cast-iron or other heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. 
                        Cook burgers until well browned, about 4 minutes. 
                        It is common for burgers to puff up due to steam from the melting cheese. 
                        Turn burgers and prick the top of each to allow steam to escape; 
                        cook until browned on the outside and no longer pink on the inside; about 4 minutes. Serve on hamburger buns.
                    </li>                
                </ol>
