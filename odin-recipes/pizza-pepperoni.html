            <ol class="list ordered">
                <li>reheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
                <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. 
                    You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier. Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
                <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice. Don't forget the pepperoni!</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
